 * MySQL Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table.
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various
 *          teachers with various students.
 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students

            SELECT * FROM university.students;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)

             SELECT first_name, last_name, c.name
             FROM teachers t
             join teachers_courses tc
             on tc.teachers_id = t.id
             join courses c
             on c.id = tc.courses_id
             and c.name = 'mathematics';

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher

            SELECT COUNT(s.id), s.first_name, s.last_name
            FROM students s
            JOIN students_courses sc
            ON sc.student_id = s.id
            JOIN courses c
            ON c.id = sc.course_id
            JOIN teachers_courses tc
            ON tc.courses_id = sc.course_id
            JOIN teachers t
            ON tc.teachers_id = t.id
            AND t.id = 50
            group by s.id;


 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject

             SELECT COUNT(s.id), s.first_name, s.last_name
             FROM students s
             JOIN students_courses sc
             ON sc.student_id = s.id
             JOIN courses c
             ON c.id = sc.course_id
             JOIN teachers_courses tc
             ON tc.courses_id = sc.course_id
             JOIN teachers t
             ON tc.teachers_id = t.id
             AND c.id = 6
             group by s.id;

            e. update a record in the student table
 *          f. add a record to the teacher table
 *
 *       8.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
