*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day

            SELECT * from
            Flight f
            JOIN FlightInstance fi
            ON f.FLNO = fi.FLNO
            AND fi.Fdate = '10/5/2020'

*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day
            SELECT * FROM
            Flight f
            JOIN FlightLeg fl
            ON f.FLNO = fl.FLNO
            JOIN Airport a
            ON a.Code = fl.FromA OR a.Code = fl.ToA
            WHERE fl.FromA = 'DFW' AND fl.ToA = 'LOG' AND fl.DeptTime = '1/1/2020 10:20';

        3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today

            SELECT * FROM
            Passenger p
            JOIN Reservation r
            ON p.ID = r.PassID
            JOIN FlightLeg fl
            ON fl.FLNO = r.FLNO
            WHERE fl.FromA = 'LAX' AND fl.ToA = 'ORD'


*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight

            SELECT * FROM
            Passenger p
            JOIN Reservation r
            ON p.ID = r.PassID
            JOIN FlightLeg fl
            ON fl.FLNO = r.FLNO
            WHERE p.ID = 2;


*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday
*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year
*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year
*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports
*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights
*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
